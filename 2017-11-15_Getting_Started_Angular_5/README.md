# Getting Started with Angular 5 Webinar

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0.

## Development Tooling

Please install the following software:

- Node.js (required)
- Python 2.7 (may be needed)
- C++ Compiler (may be needed)

I recommend using Visual Studio Code to edit your files: `http://code.visualstudio.com`

The following extensions are helpful:

EditorConfig.editorconfig
dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
mkaufman.htmlhint
wix.vscode-import-cost
DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint
glen-84.sass-lint
eg2.tslint
robertohuertasm.vscode-icons

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server and REST server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. To access the REST server directly, navigate to `http://localhost:3050/`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
